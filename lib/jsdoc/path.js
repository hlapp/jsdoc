 * directory will be considered as a fallback, and a globally
 * installed resource won't be found unless it comes with JSDoc.
 *
 * If the resource path is specified as a path relative to module or
 * package (starting with "`.`" or "`..`") JSDoc searches for the path
 * first in the current working directory, then where the JSDoc
 * configuration file is located, and finally as a fall-back under the
 * JSDoc directory. Otherwise, if the resource path is relative (not
 * starting with a path separator), JSDoc searches first under the
 * `node_modules` directory in the current working directory and where
 * the JSDoc configuration file is located, and then where JSDoc is
 * installed.
 *
 * If the resource path is specified as a fully qualified path, JSDoc uses the path as-is.
 *

 * relative to the JSDoc directory; or a path relative to the current working directory.
